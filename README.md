# Notes-App üìù
### Notes App by Kevgmd

- The goal with this project is actually pretty simple, make a responsive Notes App compatible with both mobile & non-mobile devices, made just for personal improvement and use.

- The text written is saved automatically at the browser when the text is typed, so you don't need to click any button to save it!

- Design highly inspired by [Samsung Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.app.notes&pcampaignid=web_share).
