# Notes-App üìù
### Notes App by Kevgmd

- The goal with this project is to make a really simple responsive Notes App compatible with both mobile & non-mobile devices, for personal improvement and personal use.

- The written text is saved automatically at the browser when the text is typed, so you don't need to click any button to save it.

- Design highly inspired by [Samsung Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.app.notes&pcampaignid=web_share).
