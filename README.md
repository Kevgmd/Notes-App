# Notes-App üìù
### Notes App by Kevgmd

- The goal with this project is to make a really simple responsive Notes App compatible with both mobile & non-mobile devices, for personal improvement and for personal use.

- Previously this project was supposed to be more complex than the actual release, but i still don't got the knowledge and experience to make the back-end work as intented.

- The text written it's saved automatically when the text is typed, so you don't need to click any button to save it.

- Design highly inspired by [Samsung Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.app.notes).
