# Notes-App üìù
### Notes App by Kevgmd

- The goal in this project is to make a simple responsive Notes App compatible with both mobile & non-mobile devices, for personal improvement at the Web Development branch and for personal use, of course, i don't got a time limit to complete it, so the app probably won't be finished that soon.

- Currently only the Front-End of the project got (almost) finished, currently i'm working at the Back-End.

- Design highly inspired by [Samsung Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.app.notes).

## Pull Requests
- I will only accept pull requests if i <ins>REALLY</ins> struggle with the development of the project, because as i said before, my goal is to improve my personal abilities and adquire experience at the Web Development branch during the process.
